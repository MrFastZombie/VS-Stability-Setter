A mod for Vintage Story that allows overriding chunk stability values through a Harmony patch. This will make the game itself see the chunk stability as that value, meaning the green cog will change its spin correctly to reflect the new value. Values are stored by the mod, meaning changes are non-destructive and can be undone.
